    "*A Digital Humanities Exercise: Batch converting folders of Arabic PDFs to plaintext files.*\n",

    "\n",
    "This exercise is going to have us convert a bunch of PDFs of Arabic texts and use OCR (optical character recognition) to convert them into plain text files. There is no single Python library that handles every step, and so we will have to layer our approach using several steps. Arabic OCR libraries for Python work on images not PDF files. Because of this, we will first have to convert each PDF file into its own folder of full of images, one image for each page using a library called `pdf2image`. Then, for each PDF we will have to go into its folder of images and run OCR on each page and rebuild the results in a text file which we will output to another folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish the filepaths to our desired directories (input 'PDF' and output 'img' and 'txt' folders)\n",
    "2. Estbalish contents of PDF folder\n",
    "3. Use `pdf2image` to convert each PDF to a subfolder of images, each of which will be stored inside `img` folder\n",
    "4. On each subfolder inside `img` (equivalent to a PDF) scan each image to read text\n",
    "5. Combine text of every image for a particular PDF into an output file inside `txt` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "*Libraries we will use*\n",
    "* `os` - Built-in very important library for doing anything with the operating system, allows you to write code that works across operating systems\n",
    "* `shutil` - Installed via `pip`, utilities for working with files, we are only going to use it to quickly cleanup used and temporary files\n",
    "* `pdf2image`- Installed via `pip`, library for converting a given PDF into a folder of images\n",
    "* `natsort` - Installed via `pip`, library to make it easy to naturally sort lists of things (in our case filenames)\n",
    "* `ArabicOcr` - Installed via `pip`, library for reading individual images and extracting the plain text of Arabic\n",
